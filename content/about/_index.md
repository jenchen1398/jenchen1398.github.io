I'm a recent graduate from Columbia University passionate about machine learning, music, and cooking. I've conducted research in computer vision and NLP, specifically in feature engineering, cancer cell imaging, and electronic health records. I also am an engineer experienced in designing extensible frameworks for machine learning systems. I've designed and implemented a network data analysis pipeline for Amazon EC2, a low-latency feature store for Amazon Alexa Smart Home, and a standard evaluation framework for Microsoft Research Health Futures, Hanover team. Previously I also interned at Hudson River Trading, developing machine learning algorithms to improve their data center performance.

As a violinist, I've been invited to perform at Carnegie Hall as 1st place winner of the American Protégé International Concerto Competition and as a trio in the Columbia Chamber Players. I was Co-President of Columbia Classical Performers for two years and was a co-founder of the Intercollegiate Call for Scores and our Music Through Time series (a chronological concert exploring music from medieval to now). I've served as co-concertmaster of the Idyllwild Arts Orchestra and was a violinist at the Aspen Music Festival. In San Diego, I founded the Music Outreach Club to provide free music education & music therapy to special education students and patients with dementia, and hosted benefit concerts to raise over $5000 for charities (Coffee 4 Kids Honduras & Liberty in North Korea). I study violin on scholarship from the Columbia Dolan Prize.

My other interests include cooking, reading, hiking, tennis, and photography. All photos on this website (other than portraits) were taken by me.
